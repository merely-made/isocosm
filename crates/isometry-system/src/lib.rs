//! Isometry's system-plugin lane.
//!
//! A game **system** is a schema (what fields a character has) plus Lua
//! scripts (how derived stats compute and what an action rolls). The
//! substrate stores [`SheetData`](isometry_core::SheetData); this crate
//! interprets it. The scripting engine is piccolo (pure-Rust Lua),
//! sandboxed, behind the [`System`] type so a host never touches Lua
//! directly.
//!
//! The Lua boundary stays narrow: every script function returns an **integer**,
//! and the dice expressions are assembled in Rust, so no Lua string has to cross
//! the GC boundary. It now takes up to three arguments, `f(c, t, n)`: the actor's
//! character table, an optional *target* table, and an optional scalar (a roll).
//! Lua ignores arguments a function does not declare, so `m_str(c)` is unchanged
//! by the widening while `a_attack_hit(c, t, roll)` can compare a roll against a
//! defender's AC. That target context is what lets the *system* decide what a hit
//! is, instead of hardcoding d20-versus-AC into Rust.
