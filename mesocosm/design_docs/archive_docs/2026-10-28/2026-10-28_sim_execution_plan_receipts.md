# Receipts: 2026-10-28 sim execution plan

Run evidence for `../../2026-10-28_sim_execution_plan.md` (DOC_POLICY §8).

## E1c, 2026-10-28

Played A1 battery, `played-candidate` arm, seeds 0 to 2, one worker, release,
a quiet machine (`ISOCOSM_REPRO_SEEDS=0-2`, `consumer_reproduction_battery`):

| Tree | Wall time | Lines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| main `3b2db632` | 190.3 s | seed 0 living 13, seed 1 living 243, seed 2 living 44; 3/3 |
| E1c `9664d978` | 171.1 s | identical |

The wall time covers play and the battery's two replays: 540 ticks a seed,
about 0.12 s a tick at main. isocosm's lib tests in debug: 289 passed, the
kept-filing check on; the release suite: 744 passed.
