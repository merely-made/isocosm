//! The overmap: a pointcrawl graph of sites, the board for exploration mode.
//!
//! Nodes are places; edges are routes carrying an abstract travel weight. This
//! is the map *above* the tactical maps: where `MapDocument` is a tile grid the
//! party fights on, the overmap is a graph the party travels across. Geometry
//! only: what a weight *costs* in time (5e forced-march, PF2e hexploration),
//! what a site *holds*, and what happens when you arrive are system-plugin and
//! campaign concerns layered on later. This module stores the graph and
//! searches it, and knows nothing of any of that. It moved here from the VTT's
//! `isometry-core` (ruling 599).
//!
//! Pathfinding is a bounded Dijkstra rather than the grid's uniform BFS (the
//! VTT's `isometry_core::path::reachable`): overmap routes carry unequal
//! weights, so equal per-step cost cannot serve. The *shape* is the grid's (reachable-within-budget
//! plus a path), the arithmetic is weighted.
