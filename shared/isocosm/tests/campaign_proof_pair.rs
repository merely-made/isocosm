//! Mesocosm's own suite proves the two records are structurally identical when
//! it writes them. That is the easier half — a writer can hardly be surprised
//! by its own output. The claim that matters is about the *consumer*, and it
//! can only be tested here: given two files and no other information, this
//! campaign must have no way to sort them.
//!
//! Both fixtures come from `cargo run -p mesocosm-core --example
//! emit_chronicles` and are committed unchanged. `played.chronicle` is a
//! critter driven through the world until it had eaten several dozen
//! organisms; `rng.chronicle` is one nobody ever ran.
