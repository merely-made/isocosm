//! The appearance recipe: a token is a recipe, not an image.
//!
//! An [`Appearance`] names a stack of paper-doll layers, a [`Palette`] to
//! recolour them, and the clip vocabulary its animations expose. It is tiny
//! and serde-shippable, so peers sync the recipe and bake the pixels locally
//! (design_docs/2026-07-08_campaign_packs_plan.md, decision 4).
