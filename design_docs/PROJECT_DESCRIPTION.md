## What it is

Isometry is a pixel-art isometric virtual tabletop. A group co-owns a signed,
local-first campaign space and may run play through a traditional hosted
tactical session or a shared-authority policy. It is a substrate for tabletop
systems (D&D, Pathfinder, others), not a game with rules of its own.

The feel target is a GBA-era tactics RPG: Tactics Ogre: The Knight of
Lodis, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Fixed isometric camera, 2:1 diamond
tiles, sculpted elevation, chunky sprites at low internal resolution,
integer-scaled. The bet is that easy modding beats production value: if
drawing a tileset is one Aseprite file and a manifest, groups will make
their own campaigns.

## Pillars

1. **Campaign ownership is multi-writer; tactical order is scoped.** Campaign
   authors sign independent operations that converge through p2panda. A hosted
   combat can still use one temporary sequencer over p2p transport. Holding
   that role does not make the peer the campaign owner.
2. **Maps at every scope, sculpted.** Think tactically in terms of
   Tactics Ogre-scale tight battlemaps and sprawling area maps, navigating
   to and from them through region and world maps. Same world, different
   scopes. Per-tile height is a first-class editing brush, and elevation,
   facing, and turn order are substrate features because the reference
   games treat them as terrain, not rules. (Restated by Mark 2026-09-18;
   the earlier "roughly 15x15 to 30x30" was a view, not a limit.)
3. **Modding is folders and stylesheets.** A tileset is sprites plus a
   manifest; appearance binds through CSS class vocabulary; a campaign
   can reskin the world without touching the app.
4. **Systems are plugins.** Character and item definitions are schemas;
   derived stats and dice behavior are scripts (Lua, via piccolo). The substrate
   tracks geometry and turns, never hit points. 5e SRD (CC-BY-4.0) and
   Pathfinder 2e (ORC) are the first-party system candidates.
5. **Desktop first; the web a supported tier.** The same codebase serves
   a no-install player client through genet's web lane, with a stated
   floor for what degrades there (wing design record, ruling 29). Native
   DM app first.

## Feature sketch (unplanned items are aspirational)

- Map editor: tile palette, layers, height brush, props, spawn points,
  fog regions, GM notes.
- Play: token movement with path preview, facing, initiative modes
  (individual speed order or side-based), area templates, dice roller,
  measurement, per-player fog, GM whispers.
- Character sheets: schema-driven, system plugin supplies structure and
  roll formulas.
- Campaign packs: maps, tilesets, sheets, and system choice in one
  distributable bundle.
